In this project, a watch alarm uses Digital Electronics (Synchronous Counters) to generate an alarm 
from 10min up to 50min. It uses seven segment displays to show the current time in minutes, including 
seconds. When it reaches our alarm set time, the buzzer will turn on. The alarm time resets to zero 
using a reset button and set to anytime between 10min,20min,30min,40min, and 50min.
